23-208-1,NA,"Allcott, H",NA,2011,Social norms and energy conservation,training,"This paper evaluates a series of programs run by a company called OPOWER to send Home Energy Report letters to residential utility customers comparing their electricity use to that of their neighbors. Using data from randomized natural field experiments at 600,000 treatment and control households across the United States, I estimate that the average program reduces energy consumption by 2.0%. The program provides additional evidence that non-price interventions can substantially and cost effectively change consumer behavior: the effect is equivalent to that of a short-run electricity price increase of 11 to 20%, and the cost effectiveness compares favorably to that of traditional energy conservation programs. Perhaps because the treatment included descriptive social norms, effects are heterogeneous: households in the highest decile of pre-treatment consumption decrease usage by 6.3%, while consumption by the lowest decile decreases by only 0.3%. A regression discontinuity design shows that different categories of ""injunctive norms"" played an insignificant role in encouraging relatively low users not to increase usage.

23-215-1,NA,"Ayres, I; Raseman, S; Shih, A",NA,2013,Evidence from Two Large Field Experiments that Peer Comparison Feedback Can Reduce Residential Energy Usage,training,"By providing feedback to customers on home electricity and natural gas usage with a focus on peer comparisons, utilities can reduce energy consumption at a low cost. We analyze data from two large-scale, random-assignment field experiments conducted by utility companies providing electricity (the Sacramento Municipal Utility District [SMUD]) and electricity and natural gas (Puget Sound Energy [PSE]), in partnership with a private company, Opower, which provides monthly or quarterly mailed peer feedback reports to customers. We find reduction in energy consumption of 1.2% (PSE) to 2.1% percent (SMUD), with the decrease sustained over time (7 months [PSE] and 12 months [SMUD]).",2013,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No

Insights from a behavioural economics pilot field experiment in Copenhagen, Denmark",training,"This paper examines the relationship between loss aversion and consumer behaviour in a non-price policy intervention that followed the installation of smart meter (SM) technology. Drawing upon insights from behavioural economics, we propose that consumers underestimate potential gains and overestimate potential financial losses resulting from electricity use. To test the hypothesis, we carried out a pilot study involving the installation of SM technology in Copenhagen, Denmark. The analysis used two baselines, and the differential effects revealed that the provision of loss-framed, salient information reduced daily demand by 7-11%, compared to unframed information. Reductions in standby consumption were more pronounced, with a differential effect of 16-25%. Despite the limitations inherent in a pilot study, notably the small sample size, the findings suggest that policies that address SM technology need to consider not only the pure provision of information, but also how it is designed and presented to users. Several aspects for further research are identified.",2017,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No
23-225-1,NA,"Carroll, J; Lyons, S; Denny, E",NA,2014,Reducing household electricity demand through smart metering: The role of improved information about energy saving,training,"The international roll out of residential smart meters has increased considerably in recent years. The improved consumption feedback provided, and in particular, the installation of in-house displays, has been shown to significantly reduce residential electricity demand in some international trials. This paper attempts to uncover the underlying drivers of such information-led reductions by exploring two research questions. First, does feedback improve a household's stock of information about potential energy reducing behaviours? And second, do improvements in such information help explain the demand reductions associated with the introduction of smart metering and time-of-use tariffs? Data is from a randomised controlled smart metering trial (Ireland) which also collected extensive information on household attitudes towards energy conservation and self-reported stocks of information related to energy saving. As with previous results in Ireland, we find that participation in a smart metering programme with time-of-use tariffs significantly reduces demand. Although treated households also increased their selfreported energy-reducing information, such improvements are not correlated with demand reductions in the short-run. Given this result, it is possible that feedback and other information provided in the context of smart metering are mainly effective in reducing and shifting demand because they act as a reminder and motivator.

There are however large differences in estimates of the effect of real-time feedback technologies on energy use. In this study, we conduct a field experiment to obtain an estimate of the impact of a real-time feedback technology. Access to feedback leads to an average reduction in household electricity consumption of 5.7 percent. Significant declines persist for up to four weeks. In examining time of day reduction effects, we find that the largest reductions were observed initially at all times of the day but as time passes, morning and evening intervals show larger reductions. We find no convincing evidence that household characteristics explain heterogeneity in our treatment effects; we examine demographics, housing characteristics and psychological variables.",2013,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No
23-275-1,NA,"Matsukawa, I.",NA,2018,Information acquisition and residential electricity consumption: Evidence from a field experiment,training,"This article uses hourly data on household usage of an in-home display (IHD) in a randomized field experiment to investigate how acquiring information from IHDs affects electricity usage of households. Providing IHDs, which enables households to see a graph of their half-hourly electricity consumption in real time, is a promising policy intervention that corrects for biases associated with inattention and limited information-processing capacity by promoting salience and learning. The immediate effect of providing an IHD is heightened household attention to information on consumption, and the repetition of attention is expected to improve households’ capacity to process information. The estimation results of a simultaneous equation model with discrete choice of hourly IHD usage and continuous hourly consumption of electricity of 501 households living in a southern area of Kyoto, Japan, over 36 days in summer 2012 provide evidence on the effects of real-time information feedback over time. The cumulative usage of IHDs reduced hourly electricity consumption of “energy-using” households whose electricity consumption before the experiment had been far higher than other households. Contrary to the energy-conservation literature, the cumulative usage of IHDs raised electricity consumption of “energy-saving” households whose electricity consumption had been relatively modest before the experiment. This may be due to a “boomerang effect,” which raised electricity usage of well-informed households whose electricity saving had exceeded the optimal saving before obtaining information about their actual usage. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2018,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes
