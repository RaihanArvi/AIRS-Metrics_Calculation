A combination of tailored information, goal setting (5%), and tailored feedback was used. The purpose of this study was to examine whether this combination of interventions Would result in (i) changes in direct and indirect energy use, (ii) changes in energy-related behaviors, and (iii) changes in behavioral antecedents (i.e. knowledge). After 5 months, households exposed to the combination of interventions saved 5.1%, while households in the control group used 0.7% more energy. Households exposed to the interventions saved significantly more direct energy than households in the control group did. No difference in indirect energy savings emerged. Households exposed to the interventions adopted a number of energy-saving behaviors during the course of the study, whereas households in the control group did so to a lesser extent. Households exposed to the interventions had significantly higher knowledge levels of energy conservation than the control group had. It is argued that if the aim is to effectively encourage household energy conservation, it is necessary to examine changes in energy use, energy-related behaviors and behavioral antecedents.

Results showed a reduction in average summer electricity use of 2.7% compared to a control condition.

However, empirical evidence of its effectiveness is lacking. This paper presents lessons learnt from the EU-funded EnerGAware research project, in which an innovative serious game (a game designed for purposes other than purely entertainment) was developed to promote reduced energy consumption and carbon emissions by changing social housing tenants' energy efficiency behaviour. The game was validated in a sample of European social housing using a longitudinal, two-stage experimental design, employing both pre-post and control group approaches. While some aspects of the game did not work as intended, there were nevertheless some positive impacts. The intervention increased social housing tenants' awareness and engagement in certain energy saving behaviour and provided an average electricity saving of 3.46% and an average gas saving of 7.48%. Although savings were found not to be statistically significant, an effect size was detected (0.2). Therefore, future steps should exploit all available opportunities to replicate the pilot and increase the sample size so as to gain stronger evidence of the game's impact. Preliminary results support the utility of gaming investment in the household energy efficiency field, and provide useful insights and pathways that could be incorporated into the development of future serious game interventions to foster their effectiveness.

Household decisions after the audits are recorded along with the corresponding recommended modifications and the offers for co-funding. A discrete choice model of the household decision after the audit is estimated. The results indicate that the potential improvement in heating efficiency from the proposed modifications increase the probability of implementing conservation measures. Co-funding offers also significantly raise the odds of accepting the modifications but are relatively less important than anticipated efficiency improvements. Several approaches are used. to determine whether and how much energy is saved after the audits. Electricity demand models are estimated using data two years before and after each household audit. For households who decide to Modify their houses after the audit, monthly average-electricity use per square foot decreases 7%. While there is an estimated. 2% reduction in electricity use attributed to the audit by households who decided not to adopt the proposed modifications, this reduction is not statistically significant, casting doubt on the presence of modifications in behavior from the audit information itself. For all households audited, the results from the electricity demand models suggest that the LVE home energy audit program reduced household electricity use 4.7%. In contrast, a differences-in-differences approach using synthetic control groups based upon a smaller but. still sizeable sample of 2000 observations finds that home energy audits reduce household electricity use by more than 10%. Overall, these findings suggest that home audits result in modest but significant reductions in energy use and that co-funding encourages investments that otherwise may not be privately optimal.

The research to date has a number of limitations: 1) it has not de-coupled the impact of the norm and the knowledge required to understand how to change behavior based upon it; and 2) it has not understood the impact of social norms under different incentive structures. We address these limitations using two natural field experiments. We find, firstly, that norms change energy consumption irrespective of whether information is provided or not. We find that social norms reduce consumption by around 6% (0.2 standard deviations). Secondly, we find that large financial rewards for targeted consumption reductions work very well in reducing consumption, with a 8% reduction (0.35 standard deviations) in energy consumption. The effect persists even when the financial incentive has been removed, suggesting no crowding out of financial incentives. Perhaps most interestingly, we find that the large effect of financial incentives completely disappears when information on social norms is included.

Socio-demographic attributes of individual households were recorded and building thermal performance was evaluated by detailed computer simulation. Attitudes of the study participants to environmental issues were assessed to identify potential motivations for energy savings. Although yearon-year energy consumption increased for exogenous reasons in all test groups, in Jerusalem the increase in the maximum intervention group (which received detailed information on energy consumption patterns over time, and individually tailored energy-saving tips) was 2.5%, compared to 9.5% in the reference group, which received only generic energy saving tips. The difference among groups in Nesher was not significant. A multivariate analysis confirmed that the attempt to influence apartment occupants' behaviour failed to generate a statistically significant reduction in domestic energy consumption. The study underlines the importance of controlling for endogenous factors, such as weather and building thermal performance, while evaluating the effectiveness of different intervention strategies, to avoid potentially wrong inferences about the effectiveness of such strategies.

Compared to dedicated in-home displays, smartphone/tablet apps provide a low-cost and simple design solution for making energy feedback available. This research consisted of three studies conducted with different samples within a selection of households where a smart meter was installed as part of the smart meter implementation program in the Netherlands. First, for a period of 16 months, electricity and gas consumption levels were measured for a large sample of households (n = 519) divided into an application user group and a reference group. Second, questionnaires (n = 270) provided insight in how people used the applications and to what extent the applications increased households' insight in their energy consumption and stimulated behavior changes. Third, interviews (n = 12) were held to obtain more in-depth insight. In the sample with measured energy consumption, we did not find a significant reduction in electricity and gas consumption during this research. Yet in the questionnaires, the application users reported more energy awareness and indicated to have made more investments and changes in their behavior than the reference group. Most app users started using the first app they found and did not explore the other options. The interview results indicate that, after an initial learning period, the app was used to monitor the electricity and gas consumption levels, rather than to lower them. In line with other research into feedback, the interview results suggest that the apps could be more effective with information that is more actionable and meaningful with respect to one's own specific situation and goals for the household.

We find that the need for commitment is correlated with program adoption, higher pre-adoption consumption, and lower responsiveness to goals. Consumers choosing realistic goals persistently save substantially more, achieving savings of nearly 11%, than those choosing very low or unrealistically high goals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In a quasi-experiment (N = 186), we expectedly found that registering for a web portal that provided smart-meter-based feedback led to moderate energy savings conditional on a person's environmental attitude level.

Conclusions about the performance of eco-feedback systems in the literature were mostly drawn based on their short-term performance, during which eco-feedback information was continuously provided. This study, by gradually removing eco-feedback system functions in different phases of an experiment, examines the durability of the behavior-changing effect of eco-feedback under different conditions. The eco-feedback information is delivered using mobile app, which provides a higher level of accessibility than other eco-feedback technologies. A prototype app-based eco-feedback system was developed in this study, and used in an experiment that was carried out in student dormitories. The experiment lasted for fifty-three weeks, and it included four phases, during which the level of functionality of the eco-feedback system varied. The experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of using mobile app for delivering eco-feedback information. Longitudinal analysis of the results found that the behavior-changing effect of eco-feedback changed over time. The effect was significantly positive in the short term, then became slightly positive in the medium term, and further faded to an insignificant level in the long term. Moreover, analysis of individual participants' energy consumption profiles revealed that their behavior changes were highly sensitive and responsive to whether and how eco-feedback information was delivered. This study advances the knowledge about app-based eco-feedback and its effect in reshaping the energy consumption behaviors of occupants in dormitory buildings over time. Future research can be done to further validate the generalizability of the findings to other types of residential buildings or eco-feedback systems using different technologies, so as to provide important implication and guidance for implementing eco-feedback in practice.

Thus, promoting residents' electricity saving has become an important way to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction targets in China. Although goal setting has proven effective in motivating households to save electricity, little is known about how to use feedback to motivate families to achieve challenging power-saving goals. We conducted an 18-week randomized controlled field trial in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China, to explore what kind of feedback measures can encourage urban residents to save electricity when given a challenging power-saving goal. The experiment included 4 experimental groups and 1 control group. The four experimental groups were given the same 15% power-saving goal in the first 14 weeks and received contrast feedback. Different types of feedback content (self-contrast and others-contrast) and different feedback frequencies (once a week and twice a week) were used. After 14 weeks, the contrast feedback stopped, and we observed whether the power-saving behavior was sustainable only in the target situation. We collected household electricity consumption data from the power supply company's metering system, and we performed an analysis of covariance to control the influence of residents' existing electricity consumption habits. The results revealed four key findings. (1) Setting the 15% power-saving goal and providing others-contrast feedback (OCF) effectively promoted urban residents' power savings. The goal and OCF groups saved 14.45% and 11.86%, respectively. (2) Regarding the feedback content, the power-saving effect was significantly stronger in the OCF groups than in the self-contrast feedback (SCF) groups. (3) An increase in the feedback frequency from once a week to twice a week did not substantially affect residents' electricity-saving behaviors. (4) When the contrast feedback stopped, the goal itself was insufficient to encourage residents to save electricity sustainably. After the contrast feedback process stopped for four weeks, there were no significant differences between the experimental groups and the control group. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The average saving rates of the (i) reward-intervention group (5.9%) and the (ii) reward with comparative feedback group (8.2%) are statistically larger than those of the (iii) control group (1.7%). Our study demonstrates the following. First, our econometric analysis confirmed a significant response by households to financial incentives but a more inconclusive response to the treatment that provided non-financial, additional information. Second, we found a positive influence of treatment externalities across time and households on energy saving. Third, there is a heterogeneous treatment effect in the reward-intervention group, with the households having a high New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) score being more likely to respond to the reward programme and save electricity than those that do not. Finally, and most interestingly, differences in responses to the questionnaire before and after the experiment suggest that the participants had underestimated the marginal costs of saving electricity before they actually started to do so.

While most of these programs are deemed to be cost effective, and therefore in the public interest, opportunities exist to improve cost effectiveness by targeting programs to those customers with the greatest potential for energy savings. This article details an analysis of three DSM programs offered by three Florida municipal electric utilities to explore such opportunities. First, we estimate programs' energy savings impacts; second, we measure and compare energy savings across subgroups of program participants as determined by their pre-intervention energy performance, and third, we explore potential changes in program impacts that might be realized by targeting specific customers for participation in the DSM programs. All three programs resulted in statistically significant average (per-participant) energy savings, yet average savings varied widely, with the customers who performed best (i.e., most efficient) before the intervention saving the least energy and those who performed worst (i.e., least efficient) before the intervention saving the most. Assessment of alternative program participation scenarios with varying levels of customer targeting suggests that program impacts could be increased by as much as 80% for a professional energy audit program, just over 100% for a high-efficiency heat pump upgrade program, and nearly 250% for an attic insulation upgrade program. Findings are directly relevant for utility program administrators seeking to improve program outcomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

23-320-1,NA,"WINETT, RA; NEALE, MS; GRIER, HC",NA,1979,EFFECTS OF SELF-MONITORING AND FEEDBACK ON RESIDENTIAL ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION,test,"Prior research has indicated that frequent feedback could reduce residential electricity
consumption by 10% to 15 %. However, because feedback was primarily given in written form, this procedure might not be practical. The present study evaluated a potentially
more practical feedback procedure during peak-use periods with high electricity consuming households. The study was conducted during the winter in an upper-middle
class neighborhood of almost identical, all-electric townhouses (N = 71) that averaged
about 170 KWH per day per household for a monthly bill of over $200. Twelve households received daily written feedback. Sixteen households (self-monitoring) were taught
to read their outdoor electricity meter and to record KWH used every day. A comparison
group was composed of 14 households that had volunteered to participate and 29 others
that had only given permission to have their meters read. During a 1-month period that
the procedures were in effect, the feedback group reduced consumption by 13 % and the
self-monitoring group by about 7 %. These reductions, relative to the comparison group,
were maintained during an early spring 1-month follow-up period and, to a lesser extent,
during a 6-week warm spring period. Self-monitoring participants were highly reliable
and persistent meter readers. Reductions in electricity use were reported by households
to be largely attributable to lowering of the heat thermostat, and large monetary and
KWH savings were found. Techniques to make self-monitoring cost-effective important components of the self-monitoring procedure, methods to apply self-monitoring
more broadly, and plans to combine behavioral procedures with physical technology are
discussed.",1979,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No

23-322-1,NA,"Young, Robert M",NA,2014,Variations on the normative feedback model for energy efficient behavior in the context of military family housing.,test,"In discussions on energy efficiency, the topic often involves the development of a new technology. But models that target human behavior change can also generate significant energy savings, often with less expense. One such model that has been employed to millions of households across the United States is the normative feedback model. This model integrates the most salient research from the field of social norms into the utility billing process. Residents receive a home energy report that compares their energy consumption to the average energy consumption of their neighbors. Resulting behavior changes have led to energy savings of between 1.4% and 3.1% (Alcott, 2011). This research tests three variations of the normative feedback model, with the aim of determining its boundary conditions and improving it. Each variation aligns with one of the three research objectives: 1) to determine whether normative feedback generates significant energy savings when applied to households that are not billed for utility usage, 2) to determine whether increasing the proximity of comparison increases the energy savings generated by normative feedback, and 3) to determine energy savings associated with the implementation of a normative-based utility billing system. The first two variations were tested through an experiment conducted at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where residents are not currently billed for their utility usage. Residents received normative feedback via home energy reports for three consecutive months. Results were analyzed through both a differences-in-differences analysis and a multiple regression analysis, and an overall energy savings of 3.8% was identified. Thus, the normative feedback model can generate energy savings even in the absence of a billing system and could therefore be employed in the two-thirds of military family housing that are not yet billed for utilities, with resulting savings of approximately $19.3 million annually. In the home energy report experiment, residents were compared at three different levels of proximity: neighborhood, street, and next-door neighbor. The analysis identified an energy savings of 3.8% at the neighborhood level, 4.9% at the street level, and 2.8% at the next-door neighbor level. These results indicate a ""sweet spot"" in setting the proximity level of comparisons. By increasing the proximity from the neighborhood to the street level, energy savings increased, which is consistent with expectations based on a previous study in a different context (Goldstein, Cialdini, & Griskevicius, 2008). But increasing the proximity further to the next-door neighbor level actually reduced the energy savings. Therefore, to maximize effectiveness, future applications of normative feedback for energy efficiency should make comparisons at the street level of proximity. And finally, this research investigated the use of normative feedback as the basis for a utility billing system. Such a system, as implemented at Fort Belvoir in Virginia, establishes a monthly baseline equal to the average energy consumption for that month. Residents make payments for their consumption over the baseline and receive payments for their consumption under the baseline. A multiple regression analysis found that the implementation of this billing system into a community not previously billed for utility usage generated an energy savings of 14.1%. This result takes an important first step towards the development of a billing program optimization model for the military's transition to utility billing.

The article aims to identify the effectiveness and potential of smart meters and real-time IHDs in reducing Shanghai household energy consumption by affecting occupants’ behaviour. A general landscape of the occupant behaviour in residential buildings was briefly painted. A pilot study in Shanghai with an effective sample of 131 respondents was arranged into two groups as IHD and non-IHD households. A dedicated statistical analysis model was developed based on the micro-level empirical data to investigate the characteristics and the regulations of electricity consumption in these two groups, such as check frequency, electricity consumption reduction and shifting, energy bill saving, and standby power. The research results demonstrate that IHDs could lead to around 9.1% reduction in monthly electricity consumption and about 11.0% cut off in monthly electricity bills. A general comparison of the electricity consumption reduction between this research and the average UK case was further made. Barriers at current stage and challenges for further work were finally discussed. The statistical model is expected to ‘future proof’ smart meter and real-time displays through macro-level designing in modularity and flexibility in China. The overall research initially proves the concept of the feasible impact of smart meter and display technologies in the Chinese context, which is further expected to contribute to the empirical evidence on how IHD feedback could influence household electricity consumption in the Chinese context. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2019,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No

23-230-1,NA,"Delmas, MA; Lessem, N",NA,2014,Saving power to conserve your reputation? The effectiveness of private versus public information,test,"Environmental damage is often an unseen byproduct of other activities. Disclosing environmental impact privately to consumers can reduce the costs and/or increase the moral benefits of conservation behaviors, while publicly disclosing such information can provide an additional motivation for conservation - cultivating a green reputation. In a unique field experiment in the residence halls at the University of California - Los Angeles, we test the efficacy of detailed private and public information on electricity conservation. Private information was given through real-time appliance level feedback and social norms over usage, and public information was given through a publicly visible conservation rating. Our analysis is based on 7,120 daily observations about energy use from heating and cooling, lights and plug load for 66 rooms collected over an academic year. Our results suggest that while private information alone was ineffective, public information combined with private information motivated a 20 percent reduction in electricity consumption achieved through lower use of heating and cooling. Public information was particularly effective for above median energy users. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2014,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,No

23-237-1,NA,"Fijnheer, J.D.L.; van Oostendorp, H.; Veltkamp, R.C.",NA,2019,Enhancing energy conservation by a household energy game,test,"This paper presents the results of a study, comparing a game versus a dashboard with respect to energy conservation in the household. In a pretest-posttest design, an empirical study tested whether change in attitude, knowledge, engagement and behaviour with respect to energy conservation in the household was different for participants playing Powersaver Game compared to a control condition where participants used an energy dashboard with the same content, but excluding game features. The aim of this game (developed using an iterative user-centered game design methodology) is to influence household energy consumption by means of electricity and gas usage in the long-term. The intervention time was at least 5 weeks and pre and post measures based on 21 days intervals. All energy conservation activities that the application provides (e.g. washing clothes on low temperatures) take place in the real world and feedback is based on real time energy consumption. This inverse gamification principle aims to optimize the transfer between the game world and the real world. Energy consumption significantly changed in the game condition compared to the control condition, and the difference between both conditions is more than 33% after the intervention. In the game condition, knowledge about energy conservation was significantly increased, although no significant differences in increase of attitude and engagement were found. We conclude that Powersaver Game is effective in transfer of energy conservation knowledge, which leads to energy saving behaviour on the long term. It cannot be concluded that playing the game leads to a greater change in attitude, however, attitude scores of the participants were high from the start. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2019,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,No,Yes

In study 1.40 participants living in separate or semi-detached houses in two different towns participated. All participants received a questionnaire and a list of possible energy saving measures. Households were then randomly assigned to an experimental condition (display) or a control condition (no display). In study 2, 32 households in rented apartments participated. No significant differences between the conditions were found for either of the studies. In study 2, semi-structured interviews were conducted among nine of the households. Through an analysis of interview transcripts barriers were identified explaining why the feedback intervention was not sufficient to change behaviour and reduce consumption. The barriers experienced indicate that there is a risk of overconfidence in IHDs. For the development of energy policies and more wide-scale implementation, it is important to be aware of the potential obstacles to success. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

About half of these households received feedback together with information about electricity-saving measures (pilot group), while the remaining households served as a control group. Participation in the pilot group was random, but households were able to choose between two types of feedback: access to a web portal or written feedback by post. Results from cross section OLS regression suggest that feedback provided to the pilot group corresponds with electricity savings of around 4.5% for the average household. Our results from quantile regressions imply that for households in the 30th to the 70th percentile of electricity consumption, feedback on electricity consumption is statistically significant and effects are highest in absolute terms and as a share of electricity consumption. For percentiles below or above this range, feedback appears to have no effect. Finally, controlling for a potential endogeneity bias induced by non random participation in the feedback type groups, we find no difference in the effects of feedback provided via the web portal and by post.
